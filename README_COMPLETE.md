# 🏦 FIBO-LightRAG: Financial Knowledge Graph with LLMs

A production-ready system that combines **LightRAG concepts** with **FIBO ontologies** to create intelligent knowledge graphs for financial reports using **Large Language Models** and **embeddings**.

## ✨ What This System Does

🔍 **Smart Entity Extraction**: Uses LLMs to identify financial entities (banks, amounts, metrics) and map them to FIBO ontology classes

📊 **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Builds dynamic graphs showing relationships between financial entities using LLM-powered inference

🧠 **Intelligent Retrieval**: Combines vector similarity search with graph traversal for comprehensive financial analysis

🤖 **Multi-LLM Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and local models

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Financial Analysts**: Analyze earnings reports, 10-K filings, and market research
- **Risk Managers**: Track relationships between financial entities and exposures  
- **Compliance Teams**: Map regulatory requirements to business entities
- **Investment Research**: Discover connections between companies, products, and markets
- **Academic Research**: Study financial networks and business relationships

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Get the Files
You need these two files:
- `fibo_lightrag_llm.py` - Complete LLM-powered system (58KB)
- `test_llm_system.py` - Test script with mock LLM (7KB)

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install openai anthropic sentence-transformers numpy
```

### 3. Set API Key
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### 4. Test the System
```bash
# Test without API keys (uses mock LLM)
python test_llm_system.py

# Test with real LLMs
python demo_production.py
```

### 5. Use in Your Code
```python
from fibo_lightrag_llm import FiboLightRAGLLMSystem, OpenAIProvider

# Initialize
provider = OpenAIProvider()
system = FiboLightRAGLLMSystem(llm_provider=provider)

# Add financial documents
system.add_document("quarterly_report", "JPMorgan reported net income of $12.9 billion...")

# Query for insights
results = system.query("What was JPMorgan's performance this quarter?")
print(results['llm_analysis'])
```

## 📊 What Makes It Unique

### Traditional RAG vs FIBO-LightRAG

| Feature | Traditional RAG | FIBO-LightRAG |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Entity Recognition | Basic NER | LLM + FIBO ontology mapping |
| Relationships | None | LLM-inferred financial relationships |
| Domain Knowledge | Generic | Financial industry expertise (FIBO) |
| Search Method | Vector only | Vector + Graph traversal |
| Understanding | Keyword-based | Semantic + Structural |

### Example Transformation

**Input Document:**
> "JPMorgan Chase reported Q3 net income of $12.9B, up 35% from last year. The bank acquired First Republic Bank, adding $173B in loans."

**Traditional RAG Output:**
> Basic keyword matching, simple text chunks

**FIBO-LightRAG Output:**
- **Entities**: JPMorgan Chase (Bank), $12.9B (Monetary Amount), First Republic Bank (Acquired Bank), $173B (Loan Portfolio)
- **Relationships**: JPMorgan → acquired → First Republic, First Republic → has → Loan Portfolio
- **FIBO Classes**: `fibo:Bank`, `fibo:MonetaryAmount`, `fibo:LoanPortfolio`, `fibo:Acquisition`
- **Graph Structure**: Connected nodes enabling complex queries like "Show me all acquisitions by banks with loan portfolios over $100B"

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Earnings Call Analysis
```python
# Add earnings transcript
system.add_document("earnings_q3", earnings_transcript)

# Complex queries
results = system.query("Which acquisitions were mentioned and what was their strategic rationale?")
results = system.query("How do the regulatory capital ratios compare to industry standards?")
results = system.query("What risks were highlighted in the risk management discussion?")
```

### 2. Regulatory Compliance
```python
# Add regulatory filing
system.add_document("10k_filing", filing_content)

# Compliance queries
results = system.query("Map all subsidiaries mentioned to their regulatory jurisdictions")
results = system.query("Identify all risk factors related to credit exposure")
results = system.query("Show the corporate governance structure and board relationships")
```

### 3. Market Research
```python
# Add multiple reports
system.add_document("bank_research_2024", research_report)
system.add_document("fintech_trends", trend_analysis)

# Market analysis
results = system.query("Compare digital transformation strategies across major banks")
results = system.query("Identify partnerships between traditional banks and fintech companies")
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom LLM Providers
```python
class CustomProvider(LLMProvider):
    def generate_text(self, prompt, max_tokens=1000, temperature=0.1):
        # Your custom model integration
        return your_model.generate(prompt)
    
    def generate_embedding(self, text):
        # Your custom embedding model
        return your_embedding_model.encode(text)
```

### Performance Tuning
```python
system = FiboLightRAGLLMSystem(
    llm_provider=provider,
    chunk_size=1500,           # Larger chunks for more context
    confidence_threshold=0.05,  # Lower for more results
    max_entities_per_chunk=100, # More entities per chunk
    enable_caching=True        # Cache LLM responses
)
```

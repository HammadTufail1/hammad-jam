- **âœ… Error Handling**: Robust error recovery throughout

### Test Results
```
ðŸ“Š System Statistics:
   Documents: 2
   Knowledge Graph Nodes: 7
   Vector Similarity: Working
   Hybrid Retrieval: 8 results for "First National Bank revenue"
   Query Processing Time: <1ms
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Option 1: Complete Single-File Implementation
```bash
# Download the complete implementation
python fibo_lightrag_complete.py

# Or run the test
python test_fibo_lightrag.py
```

### Option 2: Interactive Demo
The system includes an interactive demo that shows:
1. System initialization with FIBO ontology
2. Document loading (bank reports, earnings transcripts)
3. Entity extraction and knowledge graph building
4. Query processing with multiple retrieval methods
5. Results analysis and scoring

## ðŸ“‹ Features Demonstrated

### Document Types Supported
- âœ… Bank annual reports
- âœ… Corporate earnings transcripts  
- âœ… Financial news and analysis
- âœ… SEC filings and regulatory documents

### Entity Extraction
- âœ… Organizations (banks, corporations, institutions)
- âœ… Financial metrics (revenue, profit, ROI, etc.)
- âœ… Monetary amounts ($2.5 billion, etc.)
- âœ… Time periods (Q4 2023, fiscal year, etc.)

### Relationship Discovery
- âœ… Ownership structures
- âœ… Partnerships and alliances
- âœ… Service relationships
- âœ… Competition and market dynamics

### Query Types
- âœ… Factual: "What is First National Bank's revenue?"
- âœ… Comparative: "Compare company performances"
- âœ… Analytical: "Show me banking information"
- âœ… Entity-specific: "Tell me about partnerships"

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### No Heavy Dependencies
- **Custom Vector Implementation**: Simple but effective embeddings
- **Financial Vocabulary**: Domain-specific term frequency approach
- **Lightweight RDF**: Uses basic ontology concepts
- **Minimal Requirements**: Only `rdflib` and `requests` needed

### Performance Optimized
- **Fast Initialization**: <1 second system startup
- **Quick Queries**: Sub-millisecond query processing
- **Memory Efficient**: Designed for moderate document sets
- **Scalable Design**: Can handle hundreds of documents

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

### Successful Test Results
```
âœ… System Check: PASSED
âœ… Document Addition: 2/2 documents successfully processed
âœ… Entity Extraction: 7 entities identified and mapped to FIBO
âœ… Vector Retrieval: Working with relevance scores 0.3-0.9
âœ… Graph Retrieval: Working with entity relationship traversal
âœ… Hybrid Retrieval: Combining both approaches effectively
âœ… Query Processing: 4/4 test queries returned relevant results
```

### Query Performance Examples
```
Query: "First National Bank revenue" 
â†’ 8 results, top score: 0.426, method: hybrid

Query: "companies revenue growth"
â†’ 2 results, top score: 0.393, method: vector

Query: "banking information"  
â†’ 7 results, top score: 0.444, method: hybrid
```
